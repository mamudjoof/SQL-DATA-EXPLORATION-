# SQL-DATA-EXPLORATION
This project focuses on conducting data exploration and analysis on COVID-19 using SQL queries. 
It involves querying and analyzing COVID-19 to gain insights into the spread of the virus, total deaths, new cases, vaccinations etc and its impact on different continients, demography.

# WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL
The project is invaluable for understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and making data-driven decisions. 
It provides insights into the total number of new cases, deaths, testing rates, vaccination progress, and epidemiological trends. Such information is essential for researchers, 
policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public to assess the situation, implement appropriate interventions, and monitor progress over time.
